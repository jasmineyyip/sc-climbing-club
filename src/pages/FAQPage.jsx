        question: 'How do I access the slack?',
        answer: (
            <p>
                You can access the slack through our Linktree:&nbsp;
                <a href="https://linktr.ee/uscclimbing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    linktr.ee/uscclimbing

        ),
    },
    {
        question: 'Do I need any previous climbing experience to join the club?',
        answer: 'No! We try to accommodate all levels of climbing! During our first few practices, we go over basic technique/safety and can help with any questions you have. Also, every practice plan has variations for each skill level. Additionally, trips do not have a required skill level, and club trips are a great, safe way to be introduced to climbing outside. ',
    },
    {
        question: 'What gear do I need to apply to trips?',
        answer: 'We only require that you have your own climbing shoes! Besides that we can provide crash pads, ropes, and harnesses. For overnight trips, we recommend that you have our own sleeping bag and pad, but we also have a few extra of those, so not having those, should not deter you from applying for trips. ',
    },
    {
        question: 'What climbing shoes should I get?',
        answer: 'For shoes, it can depend on personal preference. Shoes go from flat to aggressive with flat not having as much of an arch shape and are good for beginners and slab climbing (an example would be the Finale or Tarantulace by La sportiva) . More aggressive shoes have more of an arch and more rubber on the toe and heel (an example would be the Skwama by La sportiva). Additionally, cheaper shoes can be found at upcycles (REI Manhattan Beach) or gear exchanges (Bishop Gear Exchange). Each climber likes different features, so it will take some trial and error to find the exact shoes you like.',
    },
    {
        question: 'How much do trips cost?',
        answer: 'Trips are completely free for members. We also reimburse gas for drivers. However, we do not reimburse for food or water, so those are the only costs you are responsible for. ',
    },
    {
        question: 'Are practices mandatory?',
        answer: 'Nope, practices do not have required attendance, but they are really fun and useful to improve technique. Attendance for comp practice is more strict, and if you miss comp practices, you will be expected to make up the practice plan on your own time.',
    },
    {
        question: 'What do I do if I miss a sign up for a trip that I really wanted to go on?',
        answer: 'Let the trip leads know that you are interested in the trip and they will put you on a waitlist. If someone drops, they will contact you.',
    },
    {
        question: 'What are each of the slack channels for?',
